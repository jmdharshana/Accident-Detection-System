# Accident-Detection-System4


# Objective

Create a smart system that spots accidents through CCTV cameras using YOLOv5. The goal is to quickly alert ambulances and police stations when an accident occurs.

# Overview

Our system employs YOLOv5 for recognizing objects in real-time. It's tailored for CCTV cameras connected to an Embedded System. When an accident is identified, it automatically sends notifications to emergency services.
